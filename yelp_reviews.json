So tasty and very authentic. Had the carne asada and carnitas tacos. Food was wonderfully seasoned with just the right amount. Love the salsa bar. Co-workers had enchiladas, quesadillas- everyone loved the food. We also shared cheese dips and guacamole. I love chunky guacamole and this fit the bill.\nYou could tell this was a popular and authentic place with white collar and blue collar coming together to enjoy good food. It was very busy but service and food was very timely.\nCan't wait to go again!",

He actually didn't clean his plate (which us unusual) because it was too spicy.\nLots of other patrons were having soup, so next time I'm going to try the seafood soup.

Also had the tacos and all were tasty. Salsa bar was a great bonus as we mixed a few to get the flavor and heat level that we enjoy. Look forward to our return.",

   "Review_Comment": "Even mid-afternoon, this place is packed -- and for good reason. The food here is outstanding.\nAlthough the menu is quite extensive, I came here for the tacos. On their own, they run between $1.99 and $2.50 a piece, which isn't particularly cheap. Instead, I went with the al pastor platter ($8.50), which comes with enough pastor to fill five tortillas, along with beans, rice, and a small salad.\nThe large portion of (likely pan-fried) pastor was quite flavorful, owing in particular to the generous amount of sliced onions they had thrown into the mix. The tortillas were somewhat thick, quite large in diameter, and durable enough that I didn't have to double layer them. The usual cilantro and chopped onion were there, of course, along with a few extra raw vegetables on the side; the green and red salsas were both pleasant enough (check out the salsa bar); and the meal is accompanied by a few green onion bulbs and jalapeno peppers, both grilled. Satisfying.\nThe selection of aguas is a bit limited -- I went with the melon over the horchata and only one other choice -- but what's there is solid.\nThis place is probably a little out of the way for many people, being so south OTP, but it's worth stopping by if you're in the area. That's, of course, of no consequence with regard to my rating.",
